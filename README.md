# CarInsuranceDataGenerator
A Python-based project for generating fictional car insurance data. The application uses FastAPI for API endpoints, Faker for generating realistic fake data, and outputs the data in JSON format. It includes details about the policy, car, and owner, making it useful for testing, prototyping, or simulating insurance-related workflows.
